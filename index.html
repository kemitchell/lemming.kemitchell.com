    <blockquote>
      <p>In general, drafters shouldn’t use this kind of recital of consideration or any other—they’re unnecessary.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=622.&amp;lawCode=EVID">California Evidence Code 622</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The facts recited in a written instrument are conclusively presumed to be true as between the parties thereto, or their successors in interest; <mark>but this rule does not apply to the recital of a consideration</mark>.</p>

    <h2 id="digits">Redundant digits cause trouble.</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/products/inv/book/297140045/"><em>A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting</em> 4e</a> 14.9:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[U]sing words and digits is more of a problem than the issue it was intended to fix—digit mistakes.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="efforts">Different “efforts” standards aren’t clear at all.</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/products/inv/book/297140045/"><em>A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting</em> 4e</a> 8.2:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <h2 id="beneficiaries">Every contract needs a no-third-party-beneficiaries clause.</h2>
    <p>Glenn D. West’s <a href="https://privateequity.weil.com/insights/naval-ramming-bows-contractual-boilerplate-standard-no-third-party-beneficiary-clauses-always-good-thing/">“On Naval Ramming Bows and Contractual Boilerplate”</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The concept that someone ca be an implied third-party beneficiary is overstated and largely a myth.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[L]ike the naval ramming bow of the past, which was created in response to a faulty perception of need and thereafter became not only useless, but also dangerous, there are cautionary tales related to the indiscriminate use of boilerplate “no third-party beneficiary” clauses, especially in light of the law’s reluctance to conclude that a nonparty is an intended third-party beneficiary in the first instance.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="choice">Choice-of-Law Clauses Need to Exclude Conflict-of-Laws Principles</h2>
    <p>John F. Coyle’s “A Short History of the Choice-of-Law Clause”:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Even though the position [that governing laws means the internal law] taken by the _Second Restatement_ accorded with the preferences of virtually all parties, and even though this position was followed by virtually every U.S. court to consider the issue, there was still the lingering possibility that a judge might misinterpret the intended meaning of the word “laws” in a choice-of-law-clause. To guard against this remote possibility, some contract drafters began to redraft their clauses.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is something of a mystery which this language caught on in the 1980s.</p>
