> Don't assume caps are either necessary or sufficient to satisfy a law requiring "conspicuous" text.

[UCC 1-201(b)(10)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-201#1-201b10):

>
> (A) a heading in capitals equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same or lesser size; and
>
> (B) language in the body of a record or display in larger type than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same size, or set off from surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language.

> The facts recited in a written instrument are conclusively presumed to be true as between the parties thereto, or their successors in interest; but this rule does not apply to the recital of a consideration.
